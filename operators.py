# There are various operators in python

#ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

a=5 
#this operator assigns the value 5 to A

a+=3
#this is an increment operarator same as a=a+3

a-=3
#this is a decrement operator same as a=a-3

#ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
#for them to work values must assigned first

a=2
b=3

a+b 
#this is an addition operator

a-b
#this is a subtraction operator

a*b
#this is a multiplication operator

a/b
#this is a division operator

a%b
#this is a modulus operator

a**b
#this is an exponentiation operator

a//b
#this is a floor division operator

#COMPARISON OPERATORS

a==b
#this tests if a is equal to b

a!=b
#this tests if a is not equal to b

a>b
#this tests if a is greater than b

a<b
#this tests if a is less than b

a>=b
#this tests if a is greater or equal to b

a<=b
#this tests if a is less or equal to b

#LOGICAL OPERATORS

a<4 and a<10
#this returns True if both of the statements are true

a<4 or x<3
#this returns True if one of the statements is true

not(a<4 and a<10)
#this reverses the result. It returns False if the result was True

#IDENTITY OPERATORS

x is y
#this returns true if both variables are the same object

x is not y
#this returns true if both variables are not the same object

#MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS

a in b
#this returns True if the value a is present in the object b

a not in b
#this returns True if the value a is not present in the object b
